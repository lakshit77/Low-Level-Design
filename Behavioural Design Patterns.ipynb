    "The Command behavioral design pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering. It encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests. It also provides the ability to support undoable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Without Command Pattern: Problems\n",
    "- Tight Coupling: Without the command pattern, the sender and receiver of a request are tightly coupled. This makes it difficult to change the implementation of the receiver or the nature of the requests without affecting the sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inflexibility: It's hard to add new commands or change existing ones without modifying the core code. This violates the Open/Closed Principle of software engineering, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difficulty in Extending: Implementing features like undo/redo becomes complex and messy as the logic tends to get scattered across various parts of the application.\n",

    "Imagine a simple application where a Button class triggers an action like saving a document. Without using the Command pattern, the Button class might directly interact with a Document class to perform the save operation."
