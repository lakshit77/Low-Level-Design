    "## Facade Design Pattern\n",
    " Resource Link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4FkHVO5iac&ab_channel=ChristopherOkhravi\n",
    " \n",
    " The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use, by providing a single entry point to a set of interfaces in the subsystem. The Facade pattern simplifies the overall system by providing a higher-level interface and hiding the complexities of the subsystem."

    "## Decorator Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decorator design pattern is a structural pattern used in software development to extend or alter the functionality of objects at runtime. It's part of the Gang of Four design patterns and is particularly useful in situations where subclassing would lead to an exponential rise in the number of classes due to the various combinations of functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Without Decorator Pattern\n",
    "Problem Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rigid Class Structure: Without the decorator pattern, you often have to extend functionalities using inheritance, leading to a rigid class structure that's hard to modify, extend, or refactor.\n",
    "- Class Explosion: If you need multiple combinations of behaviors, you end up with a large number of subclasses, each for a different combination, leading to what's known as \"class explosion.\"\n",
    "- Inflexibility: The behaviors are statically bound at compile time, making the system less flexible in terms of dynamically adding or removing functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### With Decorator Pattern\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: The decorator pattern allows adding new functionality to an object dynamically. This is done by creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.\n",
    "- Avoids Class Explosion: Instead of creating subclasses, you create a small number of classes (decorators) that are combined with the base class as needed. This reduces the number of classes and increases maintainability.\n",
    "- Enhanced Functionality: It provides a more flexible way to add responsibilities to objects unlike inheritance, as it can add these responsibilities at run-time."

    "The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural pattern used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects. It's particularly effective when dealing with a large number of objects that have some shared state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem Without the Flyweight Pattern:\n",
    "When an application requires a large number of similar objects, the memory consumption can skyrocket. Creating each object individually can consume a significant amount of memory, especially if each object has redundant state or data.\n",
